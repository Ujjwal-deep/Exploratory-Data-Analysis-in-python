# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-in-python
The purpose of this project is to master the exploratory data analysis (EDA)

## Goals of the Project
1. Explore the 911 calls dataset with Pandas Framework
2. Build different types of vizualization
3. Explain reasons for different patterns in data

## Materials and Methods
The data for this analysis will be sourced from Kaggle, a well-known platform where data science and analytics enthusiasts access a wide range of interesting datasets. Kaggle is widely used by professionals and hobbyists alike to find valuable data for various analytical and predictive tasks, making it an ideal resource for this project. The goal is to understand the dynamics of emergency situations in Pennsylvania by studying patterns such as spikes in call volumes and exploring the reasons behind these patterns. Through this analysis, we aim to identify key trends and factors contributing to observed patterns, with a focus on gaining insights into the underlying causes. This understanding will help in comprehending the nature of emergency situations and the factors influencing them, ultimately providing a clearer picture of the data-driven factors at play.

 In this project, we will try to give answers to a set of questions that may be relevant when the 911 calls data sets:
 1. Identify the top 5 ZIP codes with the highest number of 911 calls in the dataset?
 2. Identify the top 5 townships with the highest number of 911 calls in the dataset?
 3. Have there been any observable changes in the number of 911 calls that could indicate improvements in services?

## Used Libraries
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
